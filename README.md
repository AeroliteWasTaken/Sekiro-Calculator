# A simple GUI application for getting basic statistics on Sekiro enemies.

## Supports:
 - NG+ Scaling
 - Area Scaling
 - Charmless and Demon Bell Scalings
 - Attack Power Multipliers for calculating average attacks needed for a kill (NOTE: This is not an accurate measurement for your average fight, just a gauge to give you an idea of HP)

### Every main boss and miniboss is listed in the dropdown menu, but it also supports all other enemies in the game via an override for you to input NpcParamIds
### The attack override can be used to change which attack is used when calculating how many average hits a kill may take. There are currently no plans to add all attack names. For example, a jump kick would be 901. This feature is kinda useless but it's there I guess
